# Andrew's Weather Dashboard

## 🐳 Overview:
> * HTML, CSS(BootStrap), JavaScript(JQuery), Server-Side API(OpenWeather)
>
> * Using OpenWeather API's country property then passing to the flag API. 
>
> * Clear All to delete all data, trash can icon to delete single record.

> **Note**: I use free plan in OpenWeather, so in fact the data in the future is every morning weather.
